As a passionate software enthusiast, I'm driven by a relentless curiosity to explore the intricate world of software development. From the foundational layers of operating systems to the expansive realm of cloud computing, I'm committed to understanding the entire software lifecycle. My journey extends to the depths of database systems and the intricacies of code analysis, always seeking to unravel the complexities that underpin modern technology.

Education
======
I initiated my academic pursuit in Computer Engineering at [Iran University of Science and Technology](https://ce-inter.iust.ac.ir/) in 2020(**GPA 3.6/4**). Beyond the traditional classroom, I've actively contributed to the academic community. This includes serving as a Teaching Assistant and taking on a pivotal role as a Project Designer for a software engineering [CESA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cesa-iust) bootcamp. In this capacity, I was instrumental in conceptualizing, planning, and overseeing the development of a comprehensive software project, encompassing a wide range of tools and methodologies.

Courses that I was Teaching Assistant:
- Fundamentals of Programming - *Dr. Rafiei*
- Fundamentals of Database Design - *Dr. Rahmani*
- Data Structure - *Dr. Abdi*
- System Analysis and Design - *Dr. Ashtiani*
Work Experience
======
### Bale Messenger (Apr 2024 - Present)
I've been a Software Engineer at [Bale Messenger](https://www.linkedin.com/company/balemessenger), a leading messaging platform in Iran, since April   2024. Bale is a versatile app with over 30 million users, offering a wide range of features beyond messaging, including financial transactions and e-commerce.

During my time at Bale Messenger, I optimized performance through caching and asynchronous operations, developed features like Similar Channels and Story Assignment, and improved infrastructure with HPA. I also streamlined workflows with automation and built data pipelines for analytics and personalization.

### Daayar (Aug 2023 - Apr 2024)
As a part-time Software Engineer at [Daayar](https://daayar.com/), a platform for parents to connect with instructors and access educational content, I focused on building scalable and efficient backend systems. 

During my time at Daayar, I focused on enhancing the platform's backend infrastructure. I implemented MinIO for secure and scalable file storage, developed new APIs using TDD principles to ensure code quality, and optimized database performance by leveraging PostgreSQL and Redis. Additionally, I employed HyperLogLog to track user engagement and refine content recommendations.

Skills and Tools
======
I am proficient in a wide range of tools and technologies, including container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker), messaging systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ), databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Scylla), and cloud-native technologies (Envoy, Prometheus, Grafana). I have strong programming skills in Golang, Python, and C/C++, and experience with frameworks like Gin/Echo, Django, and React. Additionally, I am familiar with design patterns, eBPF, and various CI/CD tools like GitLab CI/CD.
