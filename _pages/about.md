As a passionate software enthusiast, I'm driven by a relentless curiosity to explore the intricate world of software development. From the foundational layers of operating systems to the expansive realm of cloud computing, I'm committed to understanding the entire software lifecycle. My journey extends to the depths of database systems and the intricacies of code analysis, always seeking to unravel the complexities that underpin modern technology.

Education
======
I initiated my academic pursuit in Computer Engineering at [Iran University of Science and Technology](https://ce-inter.iust.ac.ir/) in 2020. Beyond the traditional classroom, I've actively contributed to the academic community. This includes serving as a Teaching Assistant and taking on a pivotal role as a Project Designer for a software engineering [CESA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cesa-iust) bootcamp. In this capacity, I was instrumental in conceptualizing, planning, and overseeing the development of a comprehensive software project, encompassing a wide range of tools and methodologies.

Work Experience
======
### Bale Messenger
I've been a Software Engineer at Bale Messenger, a leading messaging platform in Iran, since April 2024. Bale is a versatile app with over 30 million users, offering a wide range of features beyond messaging, including financial transactions and e-commerce.

During my tenure, I've significantly contributed to the platform's performance and user experience. My key achievements include:

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced database load and improved latency by implementing caching strategies, optimizing queries, and using asynchronous operations.
- **Feature Development**: Developed new features like Similar Channels and Story Assignment, enhancing user engagement and content discovery.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**: Configured HPA for auto-scaling, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- **Automation and Efficiency**: Automated code reviews and built internal tools to streamline workflows for various teams.
- **Data Engineering**: Designed and implemented data pipelines for real-time analytics and personalized recommendations.

### Daayar
As a part-time Software Engineer at Daayar, a platform for parents to connect with instructors and access educational content, I focused on building scalable and efficient backend systems. My contributions included:

- **File Storage**: Implemented MinIO for secure and scalable file storage.
- **API Development**: Developed new APIs using TDD principles, ensuring code quality and maintainability.
- **Database Optimization**: Utilized PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and Redis for caching, improving performance.
- **Data Analytics**: Employed HyperLogLog to track user engagement and optimize content recommendations.
